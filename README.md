# Code Samples

This repository is a curated collection of code extracted from projects I’ve worked on over the past couple of years.
The code in this repository consists of parts of larger systems and games that are maintained in private repositories.

## Notes

- Code quality may vary, especially in older projects from when I was still learning and experimenting.
- Most code depends on other parts of its original project and is therefore not expected to work in isolation.
- The focus of this repository is to showcase structure, problem-solving, and implementation rather than complete, standalone projects.

## Structure

Each project is split into its own folder.
Each project has their own README files explaining the project, goals and achievements.
The year in which the project was created is included in the folder name, making it easier to follow my development and improvement over time as a software developer.
Older projects are kept intentionally to show progression rather than just end results.

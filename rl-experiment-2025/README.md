# RL experiment

Get hands on experience with reinforcement learning and how it could be used in videogames.

## Goals

- Integrate RL with Godot.
- Setup AI training playground.
- Get the RL agent to navigate through a simple maze.


## Achievements

- Got RL integrated with Godot by using stable baselines 3.
- Got a AI playground setup, training 50+ agents at once at 8x speed.
- Succeeded with getting RL agent to pathfind through simple maze.

# Mech Game

A short project where I wanted to experiment with multiplayer and 3D.

## Goals

- Get multiplayer to work across different networks (without steam)
- Get better at planning code structure and project architecture
- Get better at 3D modeling and animation

## Achievements

- I got multiplayer working across different networks while syncing movement, damage, projectiles and particles.
- Improved my ability to better plan out and architect software systems
- Got a deeper understanding of 3D modeling with clean topography and animation

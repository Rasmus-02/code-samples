# Robotics schoolwork

Some of the lab work from my robotics courses in 2025.
Both robotics projects with ROS2 + Gazebo and robotics projects in just pure Python.

## Goals

- Pass courses with good grade.
- Get a good understanding of the main concepts in robotics.
- Get used to Ubuntu.


## Achievements

- Passed both courses, with grades 3 and 4 (military service came in the way of the course I got a 3 in).
- Got a solid understanding of the most important concepts in robotics.
- Learned ROS2, Rviz2 and Gazebo.
- Got more familiar with using Ubuntu.
